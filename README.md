# Minesweeper
A quick Java version of Minesweeper I made for fun

The source code GUI relies on my Utilities class I created. The source for that and as well as the exported jar are avaliable here: https://github.com/BrianMichell/Utilities

You can only play the game once for now. It is hard-coded for a 10-10 grid with 10 bombs. 

Right click to place a flag.
Left click to reveal a space. If a bomb is clicked all the bombs will be revealed and the game will be over.
